observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Team lunch was actually fun. Miles shared photos of his kids.
* Kevin accepted help from Elijah on the DB schema.

What should change:
- My schedule is 80% meetings. No time for deep thinking.
- Ashley (my boss) is asking for 'efficiency metrics'.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Create metric dashboard for Ashley.
2. Block out 'Deep Work' time on Tuesday/Thursday.
3. Check in on Jordan's housing situation (she mentioned stress).

comments: "I feel like a bureaucrat this week. Metrics, reports, politics. I miss building things. But I need to play the game to get that Director title. At least the team seems stable for the moment."
