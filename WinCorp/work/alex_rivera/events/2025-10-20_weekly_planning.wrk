observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Alerting overhaul is 50% done. Miles is in his element.
* Tara gave a great technical talk (surprisingly).

What should change:
- I'm tired. The 'sprint' to the end of the year feels long.
- Networking has dropped off again.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Schedule 3 coffee chats for Nov (Internal Networking).
2. Finalize Kevin's promotion packet draft.
3. Clean up the backlog.

comments: "Just grinding it out. The team is stable. Tara is still here, weirdly. Maybe the job market is tough. I need to keep my energy up for the final push."
