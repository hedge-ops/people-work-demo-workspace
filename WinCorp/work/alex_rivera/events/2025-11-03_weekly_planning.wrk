Last week's wins:
* Tara accepted the retention package! She's officially staying.
* Kevin's migration project hit the 80% mark.
* Jordan handled the on-call handoff perfectly.

What should change:
- Now that the retention decision is settled is over, we need to focus purely on execution.
- Miles is asking for clarity on the holiday schedule.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Milestone review for the Migration project (Tara leading).
2. 1:1 with Kevin to prep him for the final push.
3. Sync with Ashley on Q1 headcount (now that we don't need a backfill).

comments: "Massive relief. Tara is locked in. She actually thanked me for fighting for her comp adjustment. It's built a lot of trust. Now I can sleep at night knowing my architecture is safe."
