observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Kevin's migration hit the 80% mark.
* Jordan handled the on-call handoff perfectly.

What should change:
- Tara resigned. Gave 2 weeks notice. Going to a competitor.
- The team is shocked, but honestly, the room felt lighter after she left the meeting.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Knowledge Transfer plan for Tara -> Kevin/Miles.
2. Reassure the team that we will backfill the role.
3. Sync with Ashley on how this impacts my headcount budget.

sentiment: neutral
comments: "It finally happened. Tara is leaving. I feel a mix of panic (who will do the architecture work?) and massive relief (no more toxic meetings). This is Kevin's trial by fire. I told him if he nails this transition, his Senior promo is a lock."
