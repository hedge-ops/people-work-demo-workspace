observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Tara didn't quit. She took the feedback quietly.
* Kevin presented at the All-Hands (great visibility).
* Jordan found a mentor outside the team (Hailey).

What should change:
- I'm doing too much IC work. Need to delegate.
- Networking has stalled.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Delegate the database migration plan to Kevin (good stretch goal).
2. Coffee with VP of Product.
3. Update my own brag doc.

sentiment: positive
comments: "Kevin is ready for more responsibility. Giving him the DB migration scares me a little, but he needs the growth. I feel relieved that Tara is at least listening, even if she's unhappy."
