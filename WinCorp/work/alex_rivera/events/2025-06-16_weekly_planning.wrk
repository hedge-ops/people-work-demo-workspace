observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Jordan pushed her first significant feature!
* Networking lunch with Kristina went well; she supports the cross-org initiative.
* Cleared inbox by Friday afternoon.

What should change:
- Kevin is getting cocky. He dismissed a valid concern from QA as 'user error'.
- Still haven't documented accomplishments for Ashley (my boss).

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Coaching convo with Kevin about humility vs. confidence.
2. Force a 'clean slate' brainstorming session for the team.
3. Finalize Q3 roadmap.

comments: "Better week. Seeing Jordan succeed was a highlight—she actually smiled. I need to watch Kevin; he's great, but his hubris could cause a major outage if he stops listening to others. I need to guide him without killing his drive."
