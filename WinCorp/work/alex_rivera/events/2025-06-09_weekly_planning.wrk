observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Elijah agreed to pair with Jordan 2x a week.
* Kevin identified a security flaw that would have bitten us hard.
* Got positive feedback from Cecil Parker regarding our API stability.

What should change:
- Miles complained that Tara is 'over-architecting' the new service and blocking him.
- I missed my gym session 3 times last week; need to prioritize self-care.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Mediate the architectural dispute between Tara and Miles.
2. Start the 'Brag Doc' for my Director promotion case.
3. Lunch with Kristina Xuan to align on stakeholder expectations.

sentiment: negative
comments: "The friction between Miles and Tara is escalating. Miles just wants to code and go home to his kids, and he sees Tara's meetings as obstacles. Tara feels like no one listens to her. I feel stuck in the middle. It's draining my energy for strategic work."
