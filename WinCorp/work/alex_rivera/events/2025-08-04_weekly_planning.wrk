observations: """
Last week's wins:
* Kevin successfully migrated the user table (Phase 1 complete).
* Jordan handled a customer support ticket entirely on her own.
* Coffee with Melissa Anderson (Stakeholder) went well; she likes our velocity.

What should change:
- Miles is annoyed with the 'process' updates. He just wants to code.
- Tara was late to Standup 3 times.

This week's big 3 goals:
1. Review Q3 budget.
2. 1:1 with Tara to address attendance/engagement.
3. Help Kevin scope Phase 2 (it looks too big).

sentiment: neutral
comments: "Kevin is moving fast, maybe too fast. I see him cutting corners on documentation. Tara seems… distant. She stopped commenting on every PR. It's quieter, but I'm worried. Silence from a Principal Engineer usually means they've decided it's not worth the energy to argue anymore."
