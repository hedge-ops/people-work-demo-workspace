# People Work Demo Workspace

Welcome to the **WinCorp** demo workspace! This is a sample workspace that shows how People Work can help you track and understand the relationships and interactions within your organization.

## What is People Work?

People Work is a tool that helps you map and understand the human connections in your workplace. Instead of just tracking tasks and projects, it focuses on tracking the relationships, conversations, and collaborative work that actually make organizations function.
